# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the market price of used cars based on their features. Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM, are used to predict prices.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:
- VehicleType
- Gearbox
- Model
- FuelType
- Power
- Mileage
- Registration Year

## Model Development
- **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **LightGBM** models were developed to predict the prices.
- The models were evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Zavalza/used-car-price-prediction.git
